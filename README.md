## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser (or use the optional server below)
3. Click on any game to start playing!

### Optional: Local server (click tracking & popularity order)

To save game click counts in SQLite and show games in **popularity order** on the top page:

```bash
npm install
npm start
# Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

Or with auto-reload during development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server (Hono + better-sqlite3) creates `kids_games.db` (SQLite3) in the project root and updates it when you click a game. The top page loads `/api/stats` and sorts the game cards by click count (most popular first).

For development without click tracking:

```bash
# Start a simple HTTP server
npx serve .
```
